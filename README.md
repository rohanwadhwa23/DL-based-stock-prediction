## Deep Learning to Predict the direction of the S&P500

Developed a notebook that successfully engineers 12 unique types of features → 3 for each type of feature engineering: transforming, interacting, mapping, and extracting.

Developed a deep learning classification model to predict the direction of the S&P500 for the dates 2018-01-01—2018-07-12 (test set).
